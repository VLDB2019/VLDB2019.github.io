    <h1>VLDB 2019: Information for Research and Industry Paper Presenters</h1>

    <p>Each paper has 15 minutes for presentations and 3 minutes for questions and answers.</p>
    <p>The podium in each room provides a microphone for the speakers and an HDMI connector for a laptop.</p>
    <p>Please bring your own laptop. Some adapters will be available. However, it is preferred that you bring your own adaptor given the multitude of laptop interfaces and adaptors.</p>
    <p>Please come to your session during the coffee break to check your laptop connection and ensure it works properly with the projection system. Take the time to meet your session chair who may provide you with additional instructions.</p>
    <p>Shared WiFi is available in all rooms. Its bandwidth may fluctuate dramatically depending on the number of people using it. Do not depend on the WiFi to stream video or run your presentation from a remote server. Download all elements of your presentation onto your laptop and avoid using the WiFi during your presentation.</p>
    <p>Wall power is available to the podium in all sessions.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="./?program-structure">Program Structure</a> page for a detailed schedule of your presentation time slot and its poster session.</p>
