            <h1>VLDB 2019: Sponsorship</h1>

            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p>VLDB, started in 1975, is the premier database conference. It is an international conference held annually. Different countries ranging from China to India, Germany, Brazil and USA have hosted VLDB.  It has introduced numerous influential concepts such as "Big Data", "Data Science", and "Cloud" before these names became widely used.  Some of the seminal and highly cited research papers in these topics were published in our conference. For almost half a century and after an explosive growth in the computing industry, we remain the home for the latest cutting-edge research and industrial innovation in the data arena.  Even today, the technology and research presented at our conference is typically 5 to 10 years ahead of its time.</p>
            <p>VLDB 2019 is held at Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles basin is home to premier academic institutions, think tanks, major studios and movie production facilities, and Silicon Beach with many innovative startups.  This year's VLDB has a separate but equally prestigious research and industry tracks for the papers presented at the conference.  It offers a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange and share results, providing tremendous opportunities for technological and entrepreneurial innovation.  We anticipate more than ten timely workshops to co-locate with VLDB.</p>
